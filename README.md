Osa 3, nodeJS has to be in its own repository, because it's going to be published on web.

About error handling in the project:
- It's a little bit different than in the course's theory content, because I like it more that way I've done it. So there we have our own "http-error" model, basically just a javascript class where we can create our own "error instances" and send them to the error-handling middleware.

Controllers in the separate folder:
- I've added controllers to their own folder to make the project more readable.
